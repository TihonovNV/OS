First output:
Hello
Hello
Second output:
Hello


First case: Due to the fact that "data is written when a newline character is inserted
into the stream or when the buffer is full" buffer will keep "Hello" string and output it twice 
in parent's and children's processes.
Second case: After fork buffer is empty, so program outputs once "Hello\n" and twice "\n".
